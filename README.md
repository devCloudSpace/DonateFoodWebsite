# Donate Food System

This website was developed to facilitate food donations between people in order to minimize the effects of global hunger

When considering the use of information technology for solidarity, observing the high rate of food insecurity in Brazil and in the world, 
and understanding the importance of food donations to reduce hunger, it was proposed a web application that facilitates the connection between 
a food donor and a organization, individual or legal entity that needs these donations. The user will have the freedom to request the donation of food, 
as well as to make donations.

# System Development 

The application was developed using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX and MySQL database.
